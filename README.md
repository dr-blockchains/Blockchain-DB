## Database Design

This database has four main tables and an extra table for blockchain parameters. Below is the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): 


![ERD Diagram](ERD.png "Entity Relationship Diagram of Blockchain Database")


Following are the descriptions for the tables:

#### 1. **Blocks**
- Represents individual blocks in the blockchain.
- Each block links to the previous block via its `previous_hash`.
- Includes fields for block metadata like nonce, timestamp, and hash.

#### 2. **Accounts**
- Stores public keys for senders and receivers involved in transactions.
- **Note:** While Bitcoin does not store account balances directly, this table allows tracking balances like Ethereum. If you donâ€™t want to store balances, this table is unnecessary and can be bypassed using public keys directly in the **Parties** table. 

#### 3. **Transactions** 
- This table records the transfer of value between accounts, like ACH transfers. 
- To mimic Bitcoin, each transaction can have multiple senders and multiple receivers. Thus, it has a many-to-many relationship with the **Accounts** table. 

#### 4. **Parties**
- It is the bridge table that establishes the many-to-many relationship between **Transactions** and **Accounts**.
- Tracks the amount (UTXO) associated with each party: Positive for receivers and Negative for senders.
- The sum of inputs can be equal to or greater than the sum of outputs. The extra amount is the fee (tip) that goes to the miner. 
 
#### 5. **Parameters**
- Contains blockchain constants and configurable values such as difficulty target, block reward, and other key protocol settings.

## SQL Code Structure

This repository includes four SQL scripts to set up and operate the blockchain simulation. Execute them in the following order:

#### 1. `Protocol.sql`
- Creates the database tables, stored procedures, and functions.
- Enforces access controls to prevent unauthorized changes:
  - `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations are disallowed.
  - Blocks and transactions can only be added through stored procedures.
  - New accounts and **Parties** records can be added using `INSERT`.
  - Two triggers secure data integrity in the **Parties** table.

#### 2. `Initialize.sql`
- Defines the mining procedure and creates the Genesis block.

#### 3. `Test.sql`
- Populates the database with test accounts and transactions. 
- Mines a few blocks to demonstrate functionality. 
- Can be customized to create additional transactions or blocks. 

#### 4. `Reset.sql` 
- Resets the database by removing all tables and data.
- You can start over by re-running `Protocol.sql` and `Initialize.sql`.
